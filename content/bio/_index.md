I was born in the city by the sea spent my childhood
there.

I have witnessed the country's crisis period, taking culture at the same time traditional and free.

Back then we didn't have electricity or heating, so adults had to come up with something to make the kids happier. That's why I spent most of the time in the theater since Mom used to work as a costume designer. The actors, musicians and various artists made my childhood more diverse.

Colorful and gray at the same time.

The longing for novelty, to experience, learn, know more and
To be completely free is an innate instinct of mine.
